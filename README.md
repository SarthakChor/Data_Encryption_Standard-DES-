# DES Encryption in Verilog

This project implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm using Verilog.  
It is designed and tested on Xilinx Vivado for FPGA-based encryption.  
The design follows the standard 16-round DES process with key scheduling.  
A testbench is included for simulation and verification.
